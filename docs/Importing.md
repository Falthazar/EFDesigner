# Importing Code

You can import existing C# code into your model from either classes in projects in your current solution
or from external files. The designer supports drag-and-drop from both the Visual Studio Solution Explorer
window and from Windows File Explorer.

## Importing from other projects

Select a project item from a project in the current solution, and drag/drop it onto an open space on the
design surface. The designer will parse the contents of the project item using Roslyn and attempt to add a 
class into the model.

If a class with the same name is already in the model, its properties will be cleared and any properties found
in the dropped class will be added instead. This is true even if you drop a partial class onto the model, since
the designer doesn't have any knowledge of exactly where the dropped data came from. So, for instance, if you have

```
class Foo
{
   public int Bar { get; set; }
}
```

and drop onto the designer surface

```
class Foo
{
   public string Zoom { get; }
}
```

then the definition that contains `Bar` is gone ... you're left with a `Foo` that only has a `Zoom`.

Associations will be left intact, but new associations may be added if they're found in the dropped class. 
The designer will, for associations, try to connect to any properly named classes it can find. If it can't find
one, it will create a new class (that you can later fill in by dropping that class onto the designer so it can
consume its properties).

Enumeration properties can be a challenge here. If the designer sees an existing enum with the same name as a property
type in your dropped class, it will create an enum property in the class. If not, it will assume it's a class
it hasn't yet seen and create an empty class with an association to that class. With that behavior in mind, your
best bet is to add any enumerations you're planning to use first; that way the designer knows they're enums and will
handle them correctly.

All modeling rules are applied after the drop so, if it finds problems, you'll get the typical errors and/or warnings about
things like duplicate identifiers, invalid property names and the like.

Inheritance is a tricky thing to work with when using Roslyn as a syntax parser. Consider the following:

```
class Foo : Bar, Zoom
{
   ... stuff
}
```

Clearly, `Zoom` is an interface -- .NET restrictions disallow multiple base classes. But is `Bar` a base class
or an interface? Without its definition, we really can't know for sure. Even if we saw `IDisposible` there rather than
`Bar`, we couldn't be *completely* sure without more context since we can have a class named `IDisposible` in a different
namespace (and, if you're considering ever doing that, drop me a line ... we need to have a *long* chat).

So, in those circumstances, the designer might ask you to clarify what it should do with those ... turn them into a
superclass or make them interfaces? Whatever you decide will be set in the entity properties and, of course, you can
change that decision later.

A Visual Studio limitation around drag/drop from the Solution Explorer is that you can only drag one item. So if you want to 
mass import a bunch of things, you might want to consider dragging the files from Windows File Explorer.

## Importing from Windows File Explorer

File Explorer doesn't have the one-file limitation that Visual Studio's Solution Explorer does, so you can drag to your heart's
content. The same principles apply as above.

## A Quick Tip

Importing classes via drag/drop can be a really quick way of making a POCO entity set persistent in Entity Framework.
But it's generally a bad idea to go bat crazy and drop a huge set of files all at once. LOTS of things will get created
that you'll then have to pick through and validate, edit and enhance (not every Entity Framework concept is necessarily present in 
a class definition). Take it a bit at a time -- say, one or two classes. Move the entities around the diagram so that you
can read them and validate that everything's the way you want it, then add a few more. You'll be thankful.
